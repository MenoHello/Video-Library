                        <p>Women are born with all the eggs they'll ever have—and those eggs are a key source of estrogen. During peri/menopause, the number of eggs drops significantly, and with it, estrogen levels decline. This video breaks down how that hormonal shift triggers many of the symptoms women experience, from hot flashes to mood swings and more. Understanding the root cause helps make sense of the changes happening in your body.</p>

                        <p>A new review published in the Journal of the American Medical Association urges a fresh look at hormone therapy for menopause. The findings suggest that for women in early menopause, the benefits of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) outweigh the risks. This video breaks down what the research says, why it matters, and how it could change the conversation around HRT and women’s health.</p>

                        <p>Menopause can quietly steal bone strength—often without obvious symptoms. Estrogen plays a key role in keeping bones strong, and its decline can lead to faster bone loss. This video encourages women to take action early: schedule a DEXA scan, know your numbers, and start protecting your bone health during peri/menopause.</p>

                        <h3>Why Progesterone Matters in Perimenopause + HRT</h3>
                        <p>Progesterone does more than protect your uterus—it supports your peace of mind. In this video, Dr. Noor Al-Humaidhi breaks down why progesterone is a key part of HRT during perimenopause. It helps balance estrogen to keep the uterine lining healthy, promotes deeper sleep, supports your stress response, and eases mood swings like anxiety, anger, and irritability.</p>
